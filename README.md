# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description
This webpage was designed for students taking a software development bootcamp to help better their understanding of all the facets and nuances of coding and web development. I built this because I have a passion and desire to learn how to web design so I can add to my arsenal of ways to create beautiful things for everyone to see! I was able to get a basic understanding of web development so I can get ready to hit the ground running when I start bootcamp. I hope this is of use to students who need resorces to aid them in the Software Development Journey!
